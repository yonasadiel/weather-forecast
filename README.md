The package use yonasadiel.com domain,
because in Java, package may be conflict with other programs,
so it is better to use our own domain to package naming,

The package divided to features not by layer [(ref)](https://dzone.com/articles/package-your-classes-feature),
for some benefits like higher modularity, easier code navigation,
higher level of abstraction, separates features and layers, and some more.
